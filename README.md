<em> An overview of the proposed method. First, images from a neighborhood are sampled. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to map images into the embedded space. A loss function is employed to push similar images close to each other, while keeping dissimilar images far apart. Finally, the similarity relationships are satisfied on all neighborhoods. </em>
